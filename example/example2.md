# DomainFit example

Goal: Find the domain fitted inside density2.mrc


## Step 1: Download the AlphaFold model from AFDB 
Fetching AlphaFold PDBs from a list of UniprotID
The list_protein.csv is a shorten list with 164 proteins. The output will be all the PDB models downloaded from AFDB in the pdb_files directory

	getAlphaFoldPDBs.py --ilist list_proteins.csv --odir pdb_files
	
If there are missing proteins, they will be recorded in missingAF.log file. The missing proteins tend to be big proteins > 100kD.
In this case, there are 4 missing proteins. You can predict them using ColabFold or AlphaFold. For the sake of the example, just ignore it.

> I7LWA5
> I7LU47
> Q230X9


## Step 2: Automatically divided the PDBs into domains (phenix must be sourced if it is not in the path)
This step segments the PDB in 'pdb_files' automatically into domains and writes the domain info (.domains) in the 'domains' folder with the DPAM format.

	process_predicted_models_adaptive.py pdb_files domains 10 split_model_by_compact_regions=True

In this case, using 10 processors speeds up the calculation a lot.
Example of a domain info file: Q238X3.domains

> D1	10-21
> D2	32-157
> D3	183-223


## Step 3: Saving domain-separated PDBs to 'single_domains' folder using domain info files from the previous step.
In this step, we also filter all domains < 40 amino acids & > 1000 amino acids (the upper range is for the case the domain segmentation fails) using 10 processors.

	save_domains_from_info.py pdb_files domains single_domains 40 1000 10

This process writes out 344 PDB files of single domains in 'single_domain' folder.

## Step 4: fit_domains_in_chimerax.py
Fitting all domains from 'single_domains' folder in the density2.mrc using ChimeraX: Take each domain and fit it into the density automatically using ChimeraX built in function fitmap in nogui mode. The script writes best fitted position of PDB for each domain in 'solutions' folder. The script also generates a non-sorted csv file and sorted csv file (solutions/fit_logs.csv and solutions/fit_logs_revised.csv) to document all hits and their respective values (number of residues, correlation, overlap, correlation about mean, p-value etc.). You need to determine the map level from ChimeraX (here 0.886) and the resolution of the search (here 4 â„«)

	fit_domains_in_chimerax.py single_domains solutions density2.mrc 0.886 4 200 10

Alternatively, if you want to see how the complete AlphaFold2 models fitted into the density, you can run this script for all PDBs in 'pdb_files' directory. You might got lucky if the tertiary structure of the AlphaFold2 model is good. With this, you need to use more initial search placement (400-800) and also use a bigger segmented density. Since here it is only a demonstration, just run the command below to see if you found the protein.

## Step 5: Analysing results

### Visualize the p-value & correlations
You can look at the solutions/fit_logs_revised.csv in Excel for detail. For a quick visualization of the overal fitting

	visualize_stats.py solutions/fit_logs_revised.csv
	
	
A graph of -log10(pvalue) vs. Normalized correlation coefficient should show up. The graph is also save as solutions/summaryplot.eps. In the case, the top hit (right top corner) is clearly distinct from other solutions.


### Visualize the top hits in ChimeraX
Generate a .cxc file to load the top hits for visualization in ChimeraX. Here, we choose to load only the top 5 hits with the minimum size of 80 amino acids. Size filtering is helpful in filtering small domains fitting wrongly with good correlations.

	load_tophits_in_chimerax.py density2.mrc solutions 5 80

ChimeraX is supposed to open from the terminal. If it is not, open the load_tophits.cxc using ChimeraX manually. The domains are sorted by rank, #2 = rank 1, #3 = rank 2, etc.

### Filter the solution list file size
Generate a new .csv file with a minimum size in amino acids filtering. Filter all domains < 100 amino acids. The output .csv will contain NO domain with size < 100 amino acids.

	filter_solution_list.py solutions/fit_log_revised.csv 80
	
	
## Step 6: Clean up results
Once you are done analysing and found your data, you can clean up the data. The script reads fit_log_revised.csv file in the provided directory and only keep the top X (10 in this case) hits.
